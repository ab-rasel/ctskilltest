                            <p>If you are wondering what is the best weight bench to buy in 2017, you are the right
                                place. Whether you are looking for a flat weight bench, an adjustable weight bench (aka
                                FID bench) or a workout bench, we've got you covered. We'll be giving you a round up of
                                the top rated and best selling benches available in the market right now.Generally,
                                people might think that finding the best weight bench isn’t really one of the most
                                important issues. Shouldn’t you bother with the exercise machines and weights to use
                                instead?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the truth is that the right weight bench for home use can be a crucial part of your
                                workout equipment setup. It allows you to work out at a proper angle and helps you
                                concentrate on the right muscles. It also helps in lessening the chances of an
                                injury.The trouble is that even when you read a lot of weight bench reviews or guides,
                                it can be very hard to find the right one. There are quite a few types of weight bench
                                models to choose from, and even looking over all the available models on a single site
                                like Amazon can take a lot of time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So that’s why we’ve listed down several excellent weight benches you can choose from. At
                                least one of them should provide for your needs.The Marcy Flat Utility Weight Bench is
                                your basic flat bench that’s compact and extremely affordable. It’s stable and easy to
                                assemble, but it may be too small for larger users.

                                The Escape Fitness Deck Workout Bench and Fitness station works as a flat, incline, and
                                decline (FID) bench, as well as a step bench. While it offers a lot of variety in your
                                workout, it’s not exactly built for using heavier barbells and dumbbells.The Reebok
                                Professional Deck Workout Bench is another multipurpose bench that can be used as a FID
                                bench and workout stepper. It is designed with internal storage compartment for weights
                                and resistance tubes.The Bowflex SelectTech 3.1 Adjustable Bench is highly recommended
                                for beginners. This BowFlex bench is an excellent buy for its price and que
                                The Rep Adjustable Bench - 1000 lb. Capacity is a commercial-grade FID adjustable bench
                                that’s built like tank. Yet the price is very low compared to the value you get. It does
                                tend to take up a bit of space and it’s somewhat heavy for a single person to move.
